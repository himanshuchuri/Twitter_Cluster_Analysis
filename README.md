Twitter Cluster Analysis

Abstract

This project presents a detailed and exhaustive study on understanding communities on Twitter. 
Twitter has become a great hub to share information, facts, and opinions on several topics. 
We have explored three communities in our project which are Technology, Economy, and Politics. 
We have implemented the project in three main phases which are clustering, keyword analysis, and sentiment analysis techniques to scrutinize communities based on tweets. 
The aim of this project is to examine tweets with the goal of comprehending various communities and groups of individuals more comprehensively. 
We used k-means clustering algorithms to group similar tweets from users based on the keywords of the tweets for each community. 
Further, to aid in better visualization of the clusters, the dimensionality is reduced using Multi Dimensionality scaling method. 
The clusters were analyzed using sentiment analysis techniques which are Vader, AFINN, Polarity and Subjectivity score to determine the overall sentiment or emotion expressed. 
NRC Lexicon and NRC VAD to understand the emotions associated with the sentiments of the clusters. 
Keyword analysis consisting of LDA Modelling, Word Cloud Analysis and Summarization enabled us to understand the subset of users inside the clusters. 
The project's findings indicate that sentiment in the Technology community is predominantly positive, while the Economics and Politics communities have mixed sentiments that lean towards negative. 
The analysis also revealed the top terms and themes in each cluster, as well as a significant presence of individuals from various backgrounds and domains across all communities. 

Introduction

Twitter has become a notable social media platform with over 330 million active users across the world. 
It is widely used by people of diverse backgrounds, including various age groups, races, and locations. 
The platform offers a feature to share short messages known as "tweets," which can be up to 280 characters long. 
This concise format enables users to express their thoughts, opinions, and information rapidly. 
Due to its real-time and unfiltered nature, Twitter data analysis an essential tool for obtaining insights into different communities' interests, preferences, and emotions. 
The focus of this project is to comprehend diverse groups and communities on Twitter through the implementation of clustering, keyword analysis, and sentiment analysis techniques.
 
The project's primary objective is to achieve an in-depth comprehension of the various communities and groups of people on Twitter. 
By analysing Twitter data, we can identify frequently used keywords and topics, determine users' sentiments and emotions, and cluster similar users based on their characteristics. 
The project findings can help businesses, organizations, and individuals create targeted marketing campaigns, enhance social media management, and identify emerging trends in different industries.
 
The project incorporates k-means clustering algorithm to group similar Twitter users. 
Evaluation methods such as elbow method and silhouette analysis were used to determine the optimal ‘K’ value. 
Sentiment Analysis includes VADER and AFINN tools to identify the sentiments of the texts in the clusters. 
The NRC-Lexicon and NRC-VAD algorithms are used to identify the emotions associated with these tweets in each cluster. 
Additionally, the polarity and subjectivity of the tweets are calculated to get overall sentiment insights about each cluster. 
The keyword analysis uses LDA modelling to understand the type of users in each cluster of all communities. 
By analysing the most frequently occurring words and topics within each cluster, we are able to gain insights into the interests, beliefs, and motivations of the individuals within each community. 
Word clouds are generated to show the most frequently occurring words within each cluster, highlighting the most important themes and topics within each community. 
Further, summarization technique is applied to generate short summaries of the most important insights gleaned from the analysis, making it easier to communicate these insights.


Objectives 

1.	To identify the dominant topics and themes of discussion within each community on Twitter, which will help us understand the interests and concerns of people in these communities.
2.	To explore the similarities and differences between the communities in terms of their language use, sentiment, and discourse patterns, which will help us gain insights into the patterns and behaviours of these communities on Twitter.
